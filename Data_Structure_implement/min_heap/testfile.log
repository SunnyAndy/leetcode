Inpit: 
T test case
N default of heap size
1 add
2 delete 
3 print 


// the following to be deleted



Input:
N = 4
A[] = {12,34,67,90}
M = 2
Output:113
Explanation:Allocation can be done in
following ways:{12} and {34, 67, 90}
Maximum Pages = 191{12, 34} and {67, 90}
Maximum Pages = 157{12, 34, 67} and {90}
Maximum Pages =113. Therefore, the minimum
of these cases is 113, which is selected
as the output.





Input:
