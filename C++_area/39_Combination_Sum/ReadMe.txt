the idea is from the video 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI2wc8s0BY&t=1105s 


this is a recursive  version 



because there is only two branch in each node 

so in a backtracking thinking 


you can processihg the left and return to process another one 


that is 


dfs :
  dfs :poricess ( index =0 )
  dfs :proceesing (index =1 )
